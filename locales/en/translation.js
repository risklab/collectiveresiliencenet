Our experiences and projects range from policies and plans, architecture, and products to software decision support tools. We aim to innovate on techniques, processes, and systems to embed risk reduction and preparedness into the design of cities to increase local community resilience. We engage in action research to focus on the needs of diverse cultures and contexts.'
